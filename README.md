# Pixel-Jumper
This was my first project working with the Godot game engine. I followed the tutorial below to get started with the project and learn the Godot engine. 

## Getting Started
The following instructions explain how to clone the project locally and run Pixel Jumper within Godot.

#### Install Godot 
```
https://godotengine.org/download/ 
```

#### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/michaelpermyashkin/Pixel-Jumper.git
```

#### Open Godot 
```
Open the Godot application
```

#### Run the project
```
Select 'scan' and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository
```

#### Mushrooms and Spikes
Some features I added were mushrooms and spikes. Mushrooms allow the player to regain some health that is lost from spikes or a fall. Spikes on the other hand, are a hazard the player must avoid.

#### HUD Display
This is the HUD display during the game. The HUD displays lives remaing and the total number of coins collected. Another feature I added displays whether the key has been collected. At the start of the level, the key is hollow. Once the key is collected, the key image fills in.
